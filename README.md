# Insurance Cost Comparison: Smokers vs. Non-Smokers

This project aims to investigate the impact of smoking on insurance charges by comparing the distribution of insurance costs between smokers and non-smokers. The goal is to gain insights into the financial implications of smoking on insurance premiums and provide valuable information for insurance companies, policyholders, and researchers.

## Analytical Steps

1. **Comparing Insurance Charges**: We begin by analyzing the distribution of insurance charges for smokers and non-smokers. Descriptive statistics and visualizations such as histograms and box plots will be used to highlight any notable differences between the two groups.

2. **Calculating Average Difference**: We calculate the average difference in insurance charges between smokers and non-smokers. This will give us a numerical understanding of the impact of smoking on insurance premiums.

3. **Percentage of Smokers**: We determine the percentage of smokers among all insurance policyholders. This information helps assess the prevalence of smoking within the insurance population.

4. **Percentage of Male Smokers**: We calculate the percentage of male smokers among all smokers. This analysis provides insights into the gender distribution of smoking habits within the insured population.

5. **CSV Output for Histogram**: To present the data in a visually appealing manner, we generate a CSV file that contains the necessary data to plot a histogram. This file can be used to create a histogram in various plotting libraries or tools, allowing for a beautiful and informative visualization of the insurance charge distribution.

## Repository Contents
